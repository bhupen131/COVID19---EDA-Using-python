<h2>🦠 COVID-19 EDA & Lockdown Impact in India</h2>

<h3>📌 Project Summary</h3>
<p>
The project titled <b>“COVID-19 Data Analysis and Impact of Lockdown in India”</b> is structured into three main phases:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Phase 1</b>: All the necessary libraries are imported, followed by loading and preparing the dataset.</li>
  <li><b>Phase 2</b>: Analyzing the global spread of COVID-19 through multiple stages.</li>
  <li><b>Phase 3</b>: Data analysis specific to India, where various graphs are plotted to visualize the impact of the lockdown and assess its effectiveness.</li>
</ol>

<h3>📋 Note</h3>
<p>
The output plots are not visible in the uploaded Jupyter Notebook. A separate folder containing the output plot images has been uploaded for reference.
