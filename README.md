# COVID19---EDA-Using-python
**Summary** :
The project titled “COVID-19 Data Analysis and Impact of Lockdown in India” is divided into three main steps. In the first step, all the necessary libraries are imported, followed by loading and preparing the dataset. The second step involves analyzing the global spread of COVID-19 through multiple stages. Finally, the third step focuses on data analysis specific to India, where various graphs are plotted to visualize the impact of the lockdown and assess its effectiveness.


**Note** : The output plots are not visible in the uploaded Jupyter Notebook. A separate folder containing the output plot images has been uploaded for reference.
